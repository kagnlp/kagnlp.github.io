I will go over your applications and contact you if you fit our lab. You don't have to send me another email, as the form will generate one automatically. **Unfortunately, due to a large number of requests, I won't be able to give individual feedback.**

- I'm actively looking for a postdoc. Send me your resume.  
    
- For prospective PhD students, I start contacting students for a phone interview around Feburary. If you have submitted an official application, you don't need to fill in this form unless you have additional information you want to provide.

- For prospective summer interns, please apply through the [UCLA-CSST summer program](https://csst.ucla.edu/) if applicable.  Otherwise, please send me your request by 3/31. I only take students in summer.

- For prospective UCLA undergraduates, the best way to start is to take CSM146 and my NLP CS269 seminar course. Feel free to drop by my office hours even if you're not currently taking these courses.

- For prospective UCLA master's students, feel free to drop by my office. If you're interested in doing a capstone project with me, please contact me well in advance.


If you have trouble in submitting the form, please send it to kw+apply@kwchang.net. You can find a copy of the questions [here](/documents/uclanlp-application.pdf)
